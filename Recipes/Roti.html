        <h2>If you are planning to make some delicious Roti, You are in the right place.</h2>
        <p>In simple words, roti is a flatbread made with wholemeal wheat flour. It is known as “atta” in hindi.

       <b>Instructions:</b>   
        <ol>
            <li>Take 3 cups of whole wheat flour (atta) in a bowl. Add about 1 teaspoon of salt or according to taste. Add a bit of water and 1 to 2 tablespoons ghee or oil and start mixing.</li>
            <li> Adding water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough.</li>
            <li>Continue to knead the dough. Keep adding water as required, knocking the dough down as you knead to create more gluten.</li> 
            <li>Keep on kneading till the dough becomes pliable and soft. The final dough consistency should be neither sticky nor hard. The dough for rotis is more softer than the dough kneaded for Poori (Indian Fried Bread).

                After kneading the dough, cover it with a plate or cloth and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. While you can make the roti straight away after kneading the dough, this 30 minute waiting period helps the gluten relax, which makes it easier to roll out.</li> 
            <li>Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands to smoothen it. Flatten the ball and place them on a rolling board or a clean kitchen countertop.

                Sprinkle some whole wheat flour on the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour.</li>
            <li>Turn on the gas stove and put the tawa to make it hot. The tawa has to be sufficiently hot to make soft roti. I generally make rotis on a medium-high flame.</li>  
            <li>While tawa is getting hot, start rolling the dough ball into a flat round circle.</li>   
            <li>Keep on rolling till you get an even circle as shown in the picture below. Making the roti round is not easy! With practice, you will be able to roll them round, but if they are a little misshapen at first, they will still taste good. Sprinkle some wheat flour if the dough begins to stretch or become sticky while rolling.</li>
            
        </ol>
